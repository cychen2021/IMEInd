# IME Indicator Configuration File
# This file is in TOML format (https://toml.io/)

# Timer interval in milliseconds for checking IME state changes
# Lower values provide more responsive detection but use more CPU
# Default: 500
TimerIntervalMs = 500

# Threshold in seconds before showing the toast again when window changes
# This prevents the toast from appearing too frequently when switching windows
# Default: 300 (5 minutes)
WindowChangeThresholdSeconds = 300

# Threshold in minutes before showing the toast again due to long idle time
# This ensures the toast appears periodically even if you stay in the same window
# Default: 60 (1 hour)
LongTimeElapsedMinutes = 60

# Executable names whose windows should be ignored (no toast displayed)
# Case-insensitive; specify with or without .exe
# Example: ["msedgewebview2.exe", "MyEmbeddedHost", "SomeApp.exe"]

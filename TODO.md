# TODOs

- [x] Make logging configurable.
- [x] Fix the issue that causes Zotero / Android VMs to freeze. [Fixed by excluding them from checks.]
- [x] Maybe add a blacklist to exclude apps from being checked?
- [x] Maybe the indicator should be shown around the input field? [Implemented with FloatingMode option]
- [x] Fix the bug that the pop-up floating mode doesn't float.
- [ ] Check whether the utility prevent Windows from shutting down ("Flyout window").
- [ ] Validate whether the utility cause GoldenDict-ng frozen.
- [x] Currently, the pop-up appears near the input field in the floating mode no matter whether it is focused. This feels a bit weird. [Fixed by only showing toast when input element has keyboard focus]
